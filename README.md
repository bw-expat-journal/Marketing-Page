#Expat Journal

https://expat-journal-michael-chrupcala.netlify.com/ (deployed via Netlify)

For my very first Build Week, my team and I put together a website that's designed to share our user's travel stories and pictures with the world! Users are able to register an account with us, log-in, and then create posts and upload photos from wherever they're travelling. From there, users can like and comment on posts from other expats & travellers on our site, creating lasting friendships and learning all kinds of travel tips or new restaurants to try.

## Team Contribution

HTML/CSS

- Since my team didn't have a UI designer with us, I prioritized the design and layout to find a creative presentation for the site. My landing page features a parallax scroll, and the homepage is designed with a background image that includes a pen with hand-written site text. This way the site feels organic and inspires our creative users to upload their most artistic photos.

- Although I was working on my own branch, I communicated daily with the team for the following:  
1. help build the product roadmap (located here https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EGGg6r0eoXauKAv70OptMaCKRBlZm1BM_5miGzqpHQI/edit#heading=h.4oicemcbd57).
2. keep everyone updated on my progress and to share design suggestions with the Front-End team. 
3. On Tuesday I screen-shared with the frontend & backend team while they connected the API endpoints with the Login token so I could get some exposure to React.

- Effort was taken to build a fully-responsive website for tablet and mobile users, from 500px on up. Each section of the site will adjust its width to meet the browser, and I added some animation (thanks to Animate.css code library) to the header section and the About page so that things feel more dynamic.
